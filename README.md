Agencies will have 30 days from the publication of this memorandum to designate and identify a zero trust strategy implementation lead for their organization. OMB will rely on these designated leads for Government-wide coordination and for engagement on planning and implementation efforts within each organization.

EO 14028 required agencies to develop their own plans for implementing zero trust
architecture. Within 60 days of the date of this memorandum, agencies must build upon those plans by incorporating the additional requirements identified in this document and submitting to OMB and CISA an implementation plan for FY22-FY24

The most common standard for email transit encryption today, STARTTLS, is “opportunistic,” meaning that an attacker can interfere with the secure connection and cause emails to be sent unencrypted. Such attacks have been observed at scale on the public internet.

Agencies are encouraged to participate in the NIST NCCoE’s project to examine different approaches to data categorization and the implementation of protections based on those categorizations:

For example, detecting documents containing Social Security Numbers simply by looking for 9 digits in a row is unlikely to be reliably accurate.
